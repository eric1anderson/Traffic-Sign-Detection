# Traffic-Sign-Detection

Trained multiple Convolutional Neural Network to classify 43 traffic signs.
Project is separated into 6 parts. Parts 1-5 establish a base model, experiment with activation functions, apply batch normalization, apply regularization, and increase the training window respectively. Part 6 summarizes the performance of each part and run time.
